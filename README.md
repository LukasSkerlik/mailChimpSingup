Simple webisite for collection of emails for a newsletter. 

Additional documentation on the mailchimp website.

If you want to replicate this app, don't forget to use your own api key and list id. I left mine here intentionally, as I don't really need them and as such am not concerned with a security issue
If you want to learn how to hide your own api key when pushing to github, you can follow the guide here: https://gist.github.com/derzorngottes/3b57edc1f996dddcab25
